# Secure Online Voting System Using Blockchain and Cryptography

## Overview

This project is a **Secure Online Voting System** that leverages **Blockchain Technology** and **Cryptographic Algorithms** to ensure a tamper-proof and transparent voting process. The system aims to provide a **decentralized, secure, and verifiable** online voting solution.

## Features

- **Decentralized Voting**: Uses blockchain technology to store votes securely.
- **Cryptographic Security**: Implements hashing and encryption to protect voter identities and votes.
- **Transparency & Immutability**: Once recorded, votes cannot be altered or deleted.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automates vote counting and result declaration.
- **Anonymity**: Ensures voter privacy and prevents coercion.
- **User Authentication**: Uses digital signatures or multi-factor authentication for voter verification.
- **Tamper-proof Ledger**: Votes are stored on a distributed ledger to prevent fraud.

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum / Hyperledger Fabric
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Cryptography**: SHA-256, RSA, ECC
- **Frontend**: React.js / Vue.js
- **Backend**: Node.js / Express.js
- **Database (if required)**: IPFS / MongoDB
- **Wallet Integration**: Metamask or Web3.js

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- Ganache / Ethereum Testnet
- Truffle / Hardhat
- Metamask Extension
- MongoDB (if using a database)

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-voting-system.git
   cd secure-voting-system
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Compile & Deploy Smart Contracts**
   ```sh
   truffle migrate --network development
   ```
4. **Run the Backend Server**
   ```sh
   node server.js
   ```
5. **Start the Frontend**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- **Voter Registration**: Users must authenticate and register before casting votes.
- **Casting a Vote**: Voters use their credentials to cast their vote securely.
- **Vote Storage**: Each vote is recorded on the blockchain ledger.
- **Results**: The smart contract automatically tallies and publishes results.

## Security Measures

- End-to-end encryption for data transmission.
- Public and private key encryption for voter authentication.
- Blockchain consensus mechanisms to prevent vote tampering.
- Multi-factor authentication to verify voter identity.
